Welcome to Old School Rocket League! Set your roles below to access the rest of the server! 

You can come back anytime and change these settings as your rank up or switch platforms.

**Note: If you are an SSL please select any other rank and contact any of the <@&1015667077371138208> in <#979062482133983252> for verification of your rank.**

Once your roles are assigned the rest of the server channels will be open to you! Note: channels will appear with a lock symbol, this simply means you have to have your roles set in order to use said channels. Any questions or issues with roles can be directed to me! Thanks and welcome!

We do have additional-roles that can be set as well, They are not required to use the main part of the server but feel free to check them out!
